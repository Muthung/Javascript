### Comments

Its a good practise to comment your code inorder to make it easier for other developers to understand your code.

Examples:
        - *// in-line comment*.
        - */* multi-line
           comment */*

### Data Types and Variables

Most common data types are:

* undefined: something that hasn't been defined.
* null: means nothing. 
* string: any sort of text.
* boolean: means True or False.
* symbol: an imuttable primitive value that is unique.
* number: a digit or just a number.
* object: can store alot of different key value pairs.

Variables allows a computer to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion.
Its almost like a box to fill data.

To declare variables, use: 

*var* myName = "Clinton"
*let* ourName = "Gitters"
*const* pi = 3.14
    
**var** = is used through out the whole program. <br>
**let** = is used within the scope of where you declared it. <br>
**const** = it can't be changed or else error. <br>
