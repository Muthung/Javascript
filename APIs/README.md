# Javascrip APIs

### What is an API?.

**Application Programing Interface**, is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software aaplications or systems to communicate and interact wih each other.

It defines the methods and dat formats that applications can use to request and exchange information or perform specific functions. They enable developers to access functionality of other software components, services, or platforms, often abstracting the underlying complexities and providing a standardized way to interact with them.

They are essential for building software applications that can leverage the capabilities of other services, access data from remote sources, or integrate with various third-party systems, making them a fundamental building block in modern software development.

#### REST API

**Representational State Transfer** is an API that uses HTTP requests for communication with web services.

It must comply with certain constraints:

1. **Client-server Architecture** - the client is responsible for the user interface, and the server is responsible for thebackend and data storage. Client and server are independent and each of them can be replaced.

2. **Stateless** - no data from th client is stored on the server side. The session state is stored on the client side.

3. **Cacheable** - clients can cache server responses to improve performance.



>>> From the python side, the REST API can be viewed as a data source located on an internet address that can be accessed in a certain way through certain libraries.

### Types of Requests

1. **GET** : Retrieve information. This is the most common type of request, it used to get data.

2. **POST** : Adds new data to the server.

3. **PUT** : Changes existing information in the server.

4. **DELETE** : Deletes existing information from the server.


### Working with APIs

In *Python 3*, to connect a library to send HTTP request, use **requests**.

The *request* return a repsonse, a powerful object for inspecting the results of the request. Use *response* to examine the headers and contents of the response, get a dictionary with data from JSON in the response, and also determine how successful access to the server was by the response code.

#### Status Codes

**200** - OK.

- The request was successful, the answer itself depends on the method used (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE ) and the API specifications.

**204** - No Content.

- The server successfully processed the request and did not return any content.

**301** - Moved Permanently.

- The server responds that the requested page has been moved to another address and redirects to this address.

**400** - Bad Request.

- The server cannot process the request because of the client-side errors.

**401** - Unauthorized.

- Occurs when authentication was failed, due to incorrect credentials or even its absence.

**403** - Forbidden.

- Access to the specified resource is denied.

**404** - Not Found.

- The requested resource was not found on the server.

**500** - Internal Server Error.

- Occurs wwhen an unknown error has occurred on the server.


#### Endpoints

API Endpoint is the point of entry in a communication channel when two systems are interacting. The touchpoints of the communication between an API and a server. A URL of a server or service.
Its the location where the API sends a *request* and where the *respone* eminates.

Endpoint help to depict the exact location of the resources to be accessed by API and ensuring that the software interacting with the API is functioning. The performance and productivity of APIs depend on its ability to interact with the API.

APIs are secured by :

1. Storing passwords using (One Way) or asymmetric encryption algorithms.
2. Making HTTPS the only option.
3. Enforcing a limit of the number of requests.
4. The Oath2 system solid authentication.
5. Validating user input.
