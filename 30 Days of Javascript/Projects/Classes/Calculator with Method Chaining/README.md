## Calculator with Method Chaining

### Quetion

Design a *Calculator* class. The class should provide the mahematical operations of addition, substraction, multiplication, divisin, and exponentiation. It should also allow consecutive operations to be performed using method chaining.

The *Calculator* class constructor should accept a number which serves as the initial value of *result*.

Your *Calculator* class should have the following methods:

 1.

**add** -  This method adds the given number *value* to rhe *result* and returns the updated *Calculator*.

 2.

**substract** - This method subtracts the given number *value* from the *result* and returns the updated *Calculator*.

 3.

**multiply** - This method multiplies the *result* by the given number *value* and returns the updated *Calculator*.

 4.

**divide** - Thi method divides the *result* by the given number *value* and returns the updated *Calculator*. If the passed value is *0*, an error *"Division by zero is not allowed"* should be thrown.

 5. 

**power** - This method raises the *result* to the power of the given number *value* and returns the updated *Calculator*.

 6.

**pgetResult** - This method returns the *result*.

Solutions within *10^-5* of the actual result are considered correct.
