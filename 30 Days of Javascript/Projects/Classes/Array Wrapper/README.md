## Array Wrapper

### Question

Create a class *ArrayWrapper* that accepts an array of integers in list constructor. This class should have two features:

1.

When two instances of this class are added together with *+* operator, the resulting value is the sum of all the elements in both arrays.

2. 

When the *String()* function is called on the instance, it will return a comma separated string surrounded by brackets. 

For example: *[1,2,3]*.

#### Implementation
